## KDD Process: A Typical View from ML and Statistics

```js
Input Data =>=> { Data Pre-Processing --> Data Mining --> Post-Processing } =>=> Pattern Information Knowledge
```
* Data Pre-Processing: Data integration, Normalization, Feature Selection, Data reduction.

* Data Mining: Pattern discovery, Association & Correlation, Classification, Clustering, Outlier Analysis.

* Post-Processing: Pattern Evaluation, Pattern Selection, Pattern Interpretation, Pattern Visualization.

## Major Issues in Data Mining

* Mining Methodology:

    - Mining in various way, and New kinds of knowledge

    - Boosting the power of discovery in networked

    - Handling noise data

* User Interaction

    - Interactive to mining

    - Incorporation of background knowledge

    - Presentation and visualization of data mining results

* Efficiency and Scalability

    - choosing right algorithm for this type of mining
    
    - Handling complex types of data
    
* Data mining and society
    
    - Social impacts to the data mining
    
    - Privacy of data mining
    
    - Invisible data mining
