## Types of Data Sets

* Record
    - row of the column.

* Graph and network
    - World Wide Web

* Ordered
    - Video data: sequence of images

* Spatial, image and multimedia
    - Image data

## Important Characteristics of Structured Data

* Dimensionality (دووریی)
    - < Column(A) --- Column(C) >
     
* Sparsity (بۆشایی)
    - < Value(A) --- Value(ABB) >

* Resolution (چارەسەر)
    - Chart

* Distribution (دابەشکردن)
    - Statement - Big Data
      - Ex: (csv file, big post)

## Data Objects

* Data sets are made up of data objects

* Data set are described by Element (row).

* Data objects are described by attributes (column).

  - Example

      + medical database: patients

      + university database: students

## Attributes

* Attributes representing a characteristic of data

* Types of Attributes:

    - Nominal

    - Binary

    - Numeric: quantitative

        + Interval-scaled

        + Ratio-scaled

## Attribute Types

* Nominal: "names of things" like (categories)
    - Ex: Hair_color = {auburn, black, blond, brown, grey, red, white}

* Binary: it is only 2 states (0 and 1)
    - Symmetric binary: outcomes equally important.
        + Ex: gender

    - Asymmetric binary: outcomes not equally important.
        + Ex: medical test ( positive Vs negative ) 

* Ordinal: Values are order (ranking)
    - Ex: Size = {small, medium, large}

## Numeric Attribute Types

* Quantity (integer or real-valued)
  
* Interval: Ex: temperature in C˚or F˚.

    - Measured is different

    - Values is labeled

    - Values is order

    - No true zero-point


* Ratio: temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really does mean “no heat”)

    - Measurable is different.

    - Values is order

    - Values is labeled
    
    - has true zero-point
