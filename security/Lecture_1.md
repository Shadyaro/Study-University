## Computer security:

* The protection of (information and data) to gain access by hacker, this protection can be by (integrity, availability, and confidentiality) of this information.

* the computer security protect ( hardware, software, firmware, information/data, telecommunication, ...)

* Confidentiality: protect information from (unauthorized access and misuse).

* Integrity: protect information from unauthorized alteration.

* Availability: availablity of the system to authorized users.

## Introduction

* Hack: it is activity by identifying weaknesses in (computer system or a network) to exploit the security to gain access to (personal data/information or business data/information).

* Hacker: it person that is skilled in computer programmers with knowledge of computer security, with this knowledge try to find weekness in computer (security or network) and exploit secrurity to gain access to personal data/information or buesiness data/information.

* Type of Hacker:
    
    - White Hat hacker: A hacker who has authorized access to the systems to fix the identified weaknesses.
    
    - Black Hat hacker: A hacker who has unauthorized access to the systems to find weekness for personal gain.
    
    - Gray Hat hacker: A hacker who is between white hat hackers and black hat hackers. it has unauthorized access to the systems to find weaknesses and reveal them to the system owner.
    
    - Script kiddies: A non-skilled person who want break into system using already made tools.
    
    - Hacktivist: A hacker who use hacking to send social media message. This is usually done by hijacking websites, leaving a message on the hijacked website.
    
* Ethical Hacking is identifying weakness in (computer systems or networks), and try to protect the system from this weaknesses and solve it. 

* Penetration Test: A penetration tester, is a simulare to cyber attack, that is break into system to find vulnerabilities.

* Penetration tester phases: 
    - Reconance
    - Scanning
    - Gain Access
    - Maintain Access
    - Reporting
    - Clean Track

* Reconance/Footprinting/information-gathering: in this step the attacker focus on getting meaningful information about ther target.

* Reconance phases: 
    - Using (social media) platforms
    - Performing (google hacking)
    - Performing (DNS interrogation)
    - (Social engineering)

* Active: directly interact with the system to gain information. (call)

* Passive: undirectly connected with the system. ( Google, news )

* Scanning: in this phase hacker target this information that is not visible in reconnace phase.

* The following techniqeus used in the scanning phase: 
    - Checking for any ( live systems )
    - Checking for ( firewalls )
    - Checking for ( open network ports )
    - Checking for ( running services )
    - Checking for ( security vulnerabilities )
    - Creating a ( network topology ) for the target network

* Maintaining access: After exploiting a system, the attacker should ensure that they are able to gain access to the target system at any time as long as the system is online.

* the objectives of maintaining access are as following:
    - Lateral movement
    - Exfiltration of data
    - Creating backdoor and persistent connections

* Cleaning tracks: in this phase attacker ensure that do not leave any traces on target system.

* Reporting: in this phase the attacker report with his ( finding and research also this tool and techniques ) that is use in process of finding vulnerabilites in the system.

* Vulnerability: A vulnerability is a weakness in the system, that hackers use this weakness to exploit a system to gain acccess or control over the (system or network)

* Backdoor: backdoor is methods that unauthorized users wants to be able to get high user previledge ( administrator previledge ) on a system.

* Zero day: zero day describes recently discovered security vulnerabilities that hackers can use to attack systems.

## DOS and DDOS:

* (DoS) is a type of cyber-attack, that attacker use one computer to down a server, if hacker success in this process the server is not longer response back.

* (DDoS) does the same job that (DoS) do, but the attacker use many many computers for this attack.

## TCP SYN flood attack:

* In this attack, an attacker exploits the use of the buffer space during a (TCP (Transmission Control Protocol )) session initialization handshake.

# Threat and types:

* threat in system is process of harming computer system or causing lossing data.

    - Human:
        + Nonmalicious
        + Malicious
            - Random: In a random attack the attacker want to harm any computer or user.

            - Directed: In a directed attack, the attacker want to harm the specific computers, perhaps at
            one organization

    - Nonhuman:

## Methods of attack

* **Social Engineering** : social engineering techniques to find **vulnerabilities**
    - **phishing** : send Email

* **Footprinting**

* Password Hacking: cracking password of user acccout to gain access to personal data and information.

    - Social engineering is a type of password attack.

* Botnets: Botnets are the millions of systems infected with malware under hacker control in order to carry out DDoS attacks.

* man-in-the-middle (MITM): it is a man between client and server this man filter and steal data between them, MITM attacks occur when a visitor uses public Wi-Fi network.

* Sniffing: Collect and monitor when information is exchanged. 

    - EX: Wireshark.

* Spoofing: when someone or something pretends to be something else to attempt to gain confidence.

    - Ex: Email spoofing
    - Ex: Website and/or URL spoofing
    - Ex: Caller ID spoofing
    - Ex: Text message spoofing
    - Ex: GPS spoofing
    - Ex: Extension spoofing
    - Ex: IP spoofing
    - Ex: Facial spoofing
