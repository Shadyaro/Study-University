## What is Mobile Apps ?

* mobile application is a **computer program or software application designed to run on mobile device** such as `phone, tablet, watch`, ...

* biggest app store:
  * **google play** ( android )
  * **app store** ( ios )
  * **microsoft store** ( windows 10, windows 10 mobile, xbox one ....)

## Types of Mobile Apps

1. Native Applications
   
   1. Native applications are those applications that are installed **on the device when you first buy the phone**, such as **Email**, **Calendar**.
   
   2. this application **has own runtime environment** for **execution**.
   
   3. **Highly interctive** application is **native application**

2. Browser-Based Applications

   1. A Browser-Based application is an application that is **accessed through web browser**.

   2. The Web app accessed via the **Internet**.
   
   3. Browser-Based applications are coded using **Markup Language (HTML, XML, CSS, …etc)**

## Types of Mobile Apps (3)

3. Hybrid Applications

   1. A mix of native and web-based apps.

   2. Apps developed using (React Native, Flutter, ...etc)
   
   3. These are made to support **web** and **native technologies** across **multiple platforms**.
   
   4. Advantage:
      
      1. **Easier and faster to develop**.
   
      2. using just **single code base** which **works** in **multiple mobile operating systems**.
   
   5. Disadvantage:

      1. lower performance**. 
   
## Mobile Apps Developing Model

1. Planning
2. Mobile user Analysis
3. Scenario Analysis
4. Architectural Design
   1. Navigation & User Interface Design   
5. Implementation
6. Testing
7. Deployment
8. Customer Evaluation ( هەڵسەنگاندن )
9. Maintenance ( پاراستن )


## 2. Mobile User Analysis

* This phase deals with **understanding our target (audience) for the application**

* We can gather information by:
   + **asking experts in this field ( بوار )**
   + **reading about this topic**
   + **asking right users about this topic**

## 3. Scenario Analysis

* In this phase we focus on three areas:

  1. **Screen and Interaction Analysis**
        
  2. **Usage (functionality) Analysis**

  3. **Environment Analysis**

## 7. Testing

* Testing is extremely important in mobile application development **not only due to the heterogeneity of mobile devices**

* **testing not only in an emulator but on the physical device as well**

* Testing also important to **remove bugs** and **flaws in programs** which become inevitable in **larger systems as they become complex**
